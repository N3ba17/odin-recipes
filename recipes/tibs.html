    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quis quidem delectus atque optio similique officia nobis voluptates beatae nostrum, impedit incidunt, inventore odio!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs beef, freshly grounded (without fat)</li>
        <li>¼ cup niter kibbeh (Ethiopian clarified butter)</li>
        <li>1 tsp korerima</li>
        <li>1 tsp mitmita</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by melting the niter kibbeh in a large-sized saucepan with your stove set to medium heat. Then, add the garlic, ginger, and onions along with some berbere.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat of the stove to medium-low and continue cooking for around 30 minutes until the onions start to darken, while occasionally stirring.</li>
        <li>When the onions get to a low sizzle, move them to a food processor and blend them well, but don’t let them turn into a purée.</li>
        <li>Then return them to the saucepan, add some salt, and keep them warm.</li>
        <li>Next, bring your sirloin beef, trim it of excess fat & connective tissues, cut it into small 1-ich cubes, and add some salt to all sides of the beef cubes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large-sized cast-iron skillet or pan at high heat with some oil, until it gets lightly smoky.</li>
        <li>Add the beef cubes to the pan in a single layer and plenty of space in the pan itself. If there is not enough space to add the beef cubes this way, feel free to do so in batches.</li>
    </ol>
